A smartphone website, whose base code was written before, now uploading it into GitHub.

The idea behind this website, is to create a website that is somewhat has working like GSMArena website. GSMArena is a website where all the smartphones of all brands are listed, with their details.

So, I thought that to provide the same information in a compact way, so as to grasp information about latest devices in a glance. So that smartphone enthusiasts like me get updated with latest specs of all the new smartphones.

And an another idea, is to be updated about upcoming tech, so I tried to scrape theVerge's website, because, first, is its GUI, that is very science fiction like or technologically futuristic, so that attracts me, and they provide latest news about different streams of tech.

Apart these, there are more features such as favourites, budget phones.

Currently, this is all about my website.
